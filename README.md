This is my first work project with flutter
In this app i used audioplayer v 5.2.1 to play audio from assets, all used media are from assets.
In  lib/components/colors.dart you will see all used colors in my project, maybe in future projects I'll change this teqniqe or apply with a different approach.
Also there's the lib/components/element.dart : there you will find all the used widgets.
And for the lib/screen in this file i saved all the screens i used in this app the home landing page is a navigator to all the others l.
This project was a part of flutter for beginners course by ENG:Thatwat Samy
